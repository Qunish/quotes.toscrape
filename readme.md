# Quote Scraper

This is a Python script that uses the Scrapy framework to scrape quotes from the "Quotes to Scrape" website.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Scrapy

You can install Scrapy using pip:

```
pip install scrapy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script in your terminal.

3. Run the following command to start the scraper:

   ```
   scrapy crawl quotes
   ```

4. The script will first visit the login page of the "Quotes to Scrape" website and authenticate using the provided username and password.

5. After successful login, the script will scrape quotes from the website and extract the title, author, and tag of each quote.

6. The scraped data will be displayed in your default web browser.

## Customization

If you want to customize the script, you can modify the following variables in the `QuoteSpider` class:

- `name`: The name of the spider. You can change it to a more descriptive name if desired.
- `start_urls`: The URLs to start scraping from. You can modify it to scrape quotes from a different website or page.

## Notes

- This script assumes that the website structure remains the same. If the structure of the "Quotes to Scrape" website changes, the script may need to be updated accordingly.

- Make sure to respect the website's terms of service and scraping policies.

- The script uses a hardcoded username and password for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, it is recommended to handle authentication securely and not include sensitive information directly in the script.# quotes.toscrape
